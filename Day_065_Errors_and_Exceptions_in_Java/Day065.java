// No matter how smart you are, errors are our constant companion. With practice, we keep getting better at finding and
// correcting them.

// There are 3 types of errors in Java :
// 1. Syntax error
// 2. Logical error
// 3. Runtime error -> also called exceptions

// SYNTAX ERRORS :
// When compiler finds something wrong with our program, it throws a syntax error.
// For example : int a = 5 -> no semicolon (syntax error)

// LOGICAL ERROR :
// A logical error or bug occurs when a program compiles and runs but does the wrong thing.
// For example : If you make a chatting app and wrong time of chats is being displayed or a website having incorrect redirects.

// RUNTIME ERROR :
// Java may sometimes encounter an error while the program is running. These are also called exceptions. These are encountered
// due to circumstances like bad input and/or resource constraints.
// For example : user gives string as input in a program which adds two integers.

// SYNTAX ERRORS AND LOGICAL ERRORS ARE ENCOUNTERED BY THE PROGRAMMER WHEREAS RUNTIME ERRORS ARE ENCOUNTERED BY THE USERS
