In Java, the Collections framework provides a set of interfaces and classes for working with groups of objects, such as
lists, sets, and maps. This framework is a part of the Java Collections Framework (JCF), which offers a standard way to
manipulate and store collections of objects. The collections framework consists of several core interfaces and their
corresponding implementations. Here's an overview of the hierarchy:

1. **Collection**: This is the root interface of the collections framework. It represents a group of objects, known as elements.
                   It doesn't define any specific order for the elements, and it might allow duplicate elements.
                   Subinterfaces of `Collection` include:
   - **List**: Represents an ordered collection of elements where duplicate elements are allowed. Lists are indexed and allow for positional access.
   - **Set**: Represents a collection of elements where each element is unique. Sets don't allow duplicate elements.
   - **Queue**: Extends the Collection interface for collections that use the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) ordering principle.

2. **List**: This interface extends the `Collection` interface and represents an ordered collection. It provides methods
             for accessing elements by their index.
   Subinterfaces:
   - **ArrayList**: Implements a resizable array. Elements can be accessed using an index.
   - **LinkedList**: Implements a doubly-linked list. Provides fast insertions and deletions at both ends.
   - **Vector**: Similar to ArrayList but synchronized. Considered somewhat outdated.

3. **Set**: This interface extends the `Collection` interface and represents a collection of unique elements. Implementations
            of the `Set` interface do not allow duplicate elements.
   Subinterfaces:
   - **HashSet**: Uses a hash table to store elements. Offers constant-time average complexity for basic operations.
   - **LinkedHashSet**: Extends HashSet to maintain insertion order. It uses a doubly-linked list to link the elements.
   - **TreeSet**: Stores elements in a sorted tree structure. Provides ordered traversal of elements.

4. **Queue**: This interface extends the `Collection` interface and represents a collection designed for holding elements
              prior to processing. It follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order.
   Subinterfaces:
   - **LinkedList**: LinkedList can also act as a Queue by using the methods provided by the Queue interface.
   - **PriorityQueue**: Implements a priority queue, where elements are ordered according to a comparator or the natural ordering.

5. **Map**: This interface represents a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is associated with exactly one value. Duplicate keys are not allowed.
   Subinterfaces:
   - **HashMap**: Uses hash tables for storing key-value pairs. Provides constant-time average complexity for basic operations.
   - **LinkedHashMap**: Extends HashMap to maintain the insertion order of elements.
   - **TreeMap**: Stores key-value pairs in a sorted tree structure. Provides ordered traversal of keys.

It's important to note that the above list covers only some of the main classes and interfaces in the Java Collections Framework.
There are more specialized implementations and utility classes available as well.
