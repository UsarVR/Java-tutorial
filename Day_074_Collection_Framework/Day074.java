/*
WHY DO WE NEED COLLECTIONS ?
We need collection for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in Java. For example : We use arrays to store
integers but what if we want to :
1. Resize this array ?
2. Insert an element in between ?
3. Delete an element in array ?
4. Apply certain operations to change this array ?

* Arraylist -> For variable size collection
* Set -> For distinct collection
* Stack -> A LIFO stack structure
