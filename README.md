* This repository contains small Java code examples that you can study for one hour daily. In about 3 months, you'll
  become a Java pro.

* Additionally, this repository provides practice questions with answers, allowing you to test your knowledge.

* You'll also find a zip file containing comprehensive Java notes, covering everything from the basics to advanced
  topics.
