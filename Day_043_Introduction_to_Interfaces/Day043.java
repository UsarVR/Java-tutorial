package Day_043_Introduction_to_Interfaces;

// Interface in English is a point where two systems meet and interact. For example, you can interact with you TV with the help of buttons.
// In Java interface is a group of related methods with empty bodies.
// AN EXAMPLE :
/*
interface Bicycle{
    void applyBrakes(int decrement);
    void speedUp(int increment);
    }
class FireFox implements Bicycle{
    int speed = 7;
    void applyBrakes(int decrement){
        speed = speed-decrement;
        }
    void speedUp(int increment){
        speed = speed + increment;
        }}
 */

// The difference between abstract and interfaces will be discussed in great detail in the upcoming days and when you should use which.
